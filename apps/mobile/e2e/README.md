# Mobile emulator smoke test

This opt-in [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) flow exercises sign-in, bot creation,
thread messaging, and computer takeover/release on a real Android emulator or iOS simulator. It
expects a running Rakazo stack and deliberately stays out of ordinary pull-request CI.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the Maestro CLI and start an Android emulator or iOS simulator.
2. Start Rakazo's database, API, worker, and sandbox supervisor. The computer portion requires a
   working sandbox provider (the normal local Docker provider is sufficient).
3. Create a disposable test account through the mobile or web sign-up screen. Never use a
   production account or put credentials in this repository.
4. Build/install the native app with an API URL that the emulator can reach. For the standard local
   ports, use `http://10.0.2.2:3100` on the Android emulator and `http://127.0.0.1:3100` on the iOS
   simulator. For example:

   ```sh
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3100 pnpm --filter @rakazo/mobile android
   ```

## Run

Pass all fixture values at invocation time so credentials never land in source control:

```sh
pnpm --filter @rakazo/mobile test:e2e -- \
  -e RAKAZO_E2E_EMAIL=mobile-smoke@example.test \
  -e RAKAZO_E2E_PASSWORD='replace-with-the-disposable-password' \
  -e RAKAZO_E2E_BOT_NAME=MaestroSmoke-001 \
  -e RAKAZO_E2E_MESSAGE=mobile-smoke-message
```

Use a new bot name for each run if the backing database is persistent. `clearState` resets the app's
local session and endpoint data; it does not delete server-side bots.

## Screenshot catalog

Run **Actions → mobile Android screenshots → Run workflow** to build the app, seed an isolated fake
workspace, capture light and dark Android emulator views, upload diagnostics for seven days, and publish a
persistent gallery beside the Playwright reports.
