# Archive the appdata volume from the host, not through `compose exec api`.
#
# The api image runs as `USER node` (uid 1000) with `cap_drop: ALL`, while the
# supervisor creates each bot computer's home under /data as root with mode 600
# (receipts, taught skills, connector tokens). Inside a cap-dropped container
# uid 1000 cannot read those files, so `tar` exits 2 and the archive it leaves
# behind is missing exactly the bot state a restore needs. Root on the host has
# CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE and reads all of it.
#
# Ask the running container where /data actually is, rather than rebuilding the
# volume name from a project name. `compose config` reports this file's `name:`
# key and ignores an operator's `-p` or COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, so reconstructing
# "<project>_appdata" would inspect the default project's volume on any stack
# started under another name, and silently archive the wrong one. This uses the
# same compose invocation as the pg_dump above, so both target one stack.
